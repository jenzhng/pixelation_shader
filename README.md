# Pixelation Shader

Welcome to the Pixelation Shader repository! This project showcases a custom shader effect created using Three.js. The shader simulates pixelation in real-time, transforming standard images or textures into a pixelated format. Users can dynamically adjust the pixel size via a graphical user interface (Three.js Dat.GUI), allowing for experimentation with different levels of pixelation.

## Features

- **Real-Time Pixelation**: Applies a pixelation effect to images or textures in real-time using a custom shader.
- **Dynamic Adjustments**: Users can modify the pixel size dynamically through an intuitive graphical user interface.
- **Three.js Integration**: Utilizes Three.js for rendering and shader application.
